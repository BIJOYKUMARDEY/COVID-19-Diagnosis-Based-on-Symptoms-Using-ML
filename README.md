# Building Machine Learning Model for Diagnosis Covid-19 based on Symptoms
On the basis of past data I will build a model and using this model I can guess that a person have how much chance of effecting by covid-19 and I use different symptoms of covid to build this model.

●  Downloaded Covid positive and negative dataset with symptoms data from Israel Ministry of Health
   website for more than 10 lakh Individual across Israel. Import this data in R.

●  Preprocessing the Data such that converting the qualitative data to quantitative data like “Yes”,
  “No” to 1 and 0 respectively, finding missing values and fill-up by predict the missing values using R
   packages etc.

●  Plot graphs to compare Age wise, Gender wise Covid Positive and negative case.

●  Fitting Decision Tree and XGBOOST algorithms on the dataset

●  Comparing two algorithms by their Confusion Matrix and Model Accuracy rate.

●  This machine learning model can predict that a person is Covid positive or negative base on their
   symptoms within a minute. This model can help medical team to select the positive and negative
   Persons quickly.
